Shengjie Qian:It's a beautiful night we're looking for something dumb to do
Hey baby i think i wanna marry you
Is it the look in your eyes or is it this dancing juice
Who cares baby i think i wanna marry you
Well i know this little chapel on the boulevard
We can go whoa whoa
No one will know
Oh come on girl
Who cares if we're trashed
Got a pocket full of cash we can blow whoa whoa
Shots of patrol whoa whoa

Norah Aldaghmi:
Fire on fire would normally kill us
But this much desire, together, we're winners
They say that we're out of control and some say we're sinners
But don't let them ruin our beautiful rhythms
'Cause when you unfold me and tell me you love me
And look in my eyes
You are perfection, my only direction
It's fire on fire, mmm
It's fire on fire
When we fight, we fight like lions
But then we love and feel the truth
We lose our minds in a city of roses
We won't abide by any rules
I don't say a word
But still, you take my breath and steal the things I know
There you go, saving me from out of the cold
